	Generic disclaimer:
	You acknowledge and agree that we may use data capture, syndication analysis and other similar tools to track, extract, compile, aggregate and analyze any data or information resulting from your use of the Plug-in, and that we may share or make available this information with our business partners. If you object to any of these uses, you may opt-out of certain aspects of such data tracking in accordance with the instructions herein.

	<br/><br/>
	(we neither gather statistics at this time nor plan to, but your setting regarding sharing shall be resepcted at any such time, and the plan would be to share this data in a GDPR compliant fashion that is lets face it fully reversable and decryptable and a security joke... eihter way the ISP and web host WILL decrypt,steal,sell everything and the finger always points to the person who never made a cent to take the blame, so in all honestly do not expect any of this horrible stuff until or unless this extension changes hands.)
	
	<br/><br/>To Opt-Out use preferences at the left and disable "Share Video Statistics".  If you participate videos that recieve over 10 unique views from participants will make the top videos list at vidzbigger.com (note website is offline, defunct, I presume it to be archive hacked, etc, because hateful idiots hate, they do pretend they're the good guys... there are none.  Cover up and burrial are the same thing, you and you can't burry what underlies every good.  You can burry the dead, but death will keep coming up idiots.  You can't blame someone as idiots and pretend good is achieved.)  Hate drives every lie percieved as good, even in those @holes with a perfect record, fearful of any mark against them, nothing is more hateful spinless and absentee than fear.  To want a different society that is real and fearles (especially of speech/discourse which does not constitute a thing worthy of fear) is the only worthy drive, and all forces against it must be crushed.  Unfortunately we continue to achieve a cake posessor eating cake to serve itself, and an unfree world no matter which side the coin flops down on, fear exists to constrain and it is the biggest looser idiot.  To be free of idiots is to be dead, or to define some alternative.  Every good will always fall to ruin, the appeasement of fools.  Good will only come to society when censorship costs money AND a 75% portion of that money goes ot the censored speaker, who is the only true victim (of censorship, their time taken to speak wasted by oppresive and thereore utterly worthless forces the world would be better off without... or worse yet, censored by the very theives who stole the speech for themselves to publish as their own.).
